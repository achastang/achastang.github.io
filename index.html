    <h2 class="titles">About Me</h2>
    <div class="aboutpara">
      <p id="para1">I’m from Faversham, England, and currently attend Stonehill College in Massachusetts. I’ve been playing tennis for 16 years, and fulfilling my dream of competing at Division 1 level led me to Stonehill. While I’ve always enjoyed math, it wasn’t until my freshman year of college that I discovered a passion for computer science. I’m especially drawn to data science and web development, but I enjoy all forms of problem-solving and am always eager to learn more in the field. </p>
      <p id="para2">Outside the classroom, I'm a member of Stonehill’s Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC). I serve as a spokesperson for my teammates, advocating for their needs and contributing to efforts that enhance the student-athlete experience. To take a more active role, I also manage tournament logistics for charity sports events, such as dodgeball, cornhole, and kickball. I coordinate match lengths, formats, and other details to ensure smooth operations and successful fundraising for the Jay Fund. Additionally, I actively participate in meetings of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) on campus. </p>
      <p id="para3">Alongside my competitive tennis experience, I'm a certified Level 1 tennis coach and an official court supervisor; qualifications I regularly put to use at my home club, Canterbury Tennis Club. While tennis has always been my main sport, I’m also a huge football (soccer) fan. No matter how busy I am, I always make time to watch Arsenal play, including preseason friendlies.</p>
